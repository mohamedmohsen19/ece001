Narrow AI can fail in unpredictable ways if it goes beyond its limits.Apple Siriis a good example of Narrow AI, but it operates with a limited pre-defined range of functions.IBM's Watson supercomputer also comes under Narrow AI, as it uses an Expert system approach combined with Machine learning and natural language processing.Some Examples of Narrow AI are playing chess, purchasing suggestions on e-commerce site, self-driving cars, speech recognition, and image recognition.</p>
